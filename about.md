I am a data scientist, software engineer(ish), and somewhat recovered mathematician. I
have an MPhil in Group Theory, and a PhD in Computer Algebra Systems, both from the
University of Birmingham. In 2006-07, and since 2013, I have worked in retail energy
supply, with a focus on risk, and energy efficiency.
